Husbands Vs Horses Good Things About Husbands:   Husbands are less expensive to shoe. Feeding a husband doesn't require anything that even mildly compares with the hassle of putting up hay. A lame husband can still work. A husband with a belly-ache doesn't have to be walked. Husbands don't try to scratch their heads on your back. They're better able to understand puns. If they're playing hard to catch you *may* be able to run them down on foot. They know their name. They pay their own bills. They apologize when they step on your toes. They seldom refuse to get in the vehicle. They don't panic, yelling and running all through the house when you leave them alone. (unless you left the kids too) For a nominal fee you can hire someone else to clip them.   The Horse's Advantage:   If they don't work out you can sell them. They don't come with in-laws. You don't have to worry about your children looking like them. You never have to iron their saddle pads. If you get too fat for one you can shop for a bigger one. They smell good when they sweat. You can repair their "clothes" with duct tape. It's possible to keep them from "jumping the fence". You can force them to stay in good physical condition...with a whip if necessary. They don't want their turn at the computer. They turn white with age, but not bald. They learn to accept restraint. They don't care what you look like, as long as you have a carrot.

African Jack Once upon a time, long, long ago there were two unique lions in the jungles of Africa. Both, it seems, had human-like qualities that allowed them to claim territory, daring the other to cross over the line. Strange as it seems, the boundary between their turf became a well traveled trail through the jungle.     All day, every day, both lions lay in the brush staring across the trail at their compatriot, daring him to cross into their territory.     The local natives knew of this animal feud, but all this was unbeknown to African Jack, a well-known and very publicized guide who did not speak Lionese and was unfamiliar with the territory.     While he was leading a safari through the jungle, the travelers had to walk and cut vines with their machetes, and all this constant hacking brush had them worn to a frazzle. After seeing two or three of his safari drop from exhaustion, African Jack decided to stop on the trail between these two lions and camp for the night.     After setting up camp, eating, and getting his safari settled African Jack sat on a stump and began reading. While he was busily engaged in the printed page, the two lions, simultaneously, pounced on African Jack and ate him on the spot.     When the 6 o'clock news heard of the tragedy, they reported, "African Jack killed this evening. The motive is unclear, but it is reported he was reading between the lions."

It was 1988. A couple lived near the ocean and used to walk the beach a lot... ... One summer they noticed a girl who was at the beach pretty much every day. She wasn’t unusual, nor was the travel bag she carried, except for one thing. She would approach people who were sitting on the beach, glance around, then speak to them.  Generally, the people would respond negatively and she would wander off, but occasionally someone would nod and there would be a quick exchange of money for something she carried in her bag. The couple assumed she was selling drugs and debated calling the cops, but since they didn’t know for sure they just continued to watch her.  After a couple of weeks the wife asked, “Honey, have you ever noticed that she only goes up to people with boom boxes and other electronic devices?”  He hadn’t and said so. Then she said, “Tomorrow I want you to get a towel and our big radio and go lie out on the beach. Then we can find out what she’s really doing.”  Well, the plan went off without a hitch, and the wife was almost hopping up and down with anticipation when she saw the girl talk to her husband and then leave. The man walked up the beach and met his wife at the road. “Well, is she selling drugs?” she asked excitedly.”  “No, she’s not.” he said, enjoying this probably more than he should have.  “Well, what is it, then?” his wife fairly shrieked.  The man grinned and said. “Her name is Sheena, but she prefers to be called 'shee', and she’s selling batteries.”  “Batteries?” cried the wife.  “Yes,” he replied. “Shee sells C cells by the Seashore.”

Sheer Genius After finishing an out-of-town errand, I discovered that my car wouldn't start because it was out of gas. A passer-by told me there was a service station a half-mile away, so I took a gas can from the trunk and trudged the distance in the sweltering sun.  The attendant filled my two-gallon can, and I lugged it back and poured the gas into the tank. But when I tried to unlock the car door, it wouldn't open. Just then, I noticed an identical old car parked a short distance away. THAT was my car, I had filled a strangers gas tank.  Wearily I walked back to the station. "You know," the attendant suggested helpfully, "instead of walking back and forth to fill the tank from the can, you could put a couple of gallons in the tank and then drive the car here "

A Dog Story Shortly after our 10 year old Cocker Spanial died, I brought a 2 year old Golden Retriever rescue pup home.  Both my wife and I had grown up with large dogs so we thought a larger dog might stand a better chance with our growing family of 3 boys, (soon to be 4 boys).  When our 2 older sons and I arrived home with the 140 pound pup, my wife met us with an OMG look of surprise. She was expecting a lot smaller dog. I tried to calm her by telling her that the lady who was rehoming him said that he liked children. She replied to my comment with "By the size of him, he must like to have 2 children a day!"  He was the best dog ever. He really did like kids!

Keeps people away like a charm.”  “That’s super smart!” the doctor says. “I’m gonna do that!” The next day, the doctor makes up his bills for all the people who asked him for medical advice, and he takes them out to his mailbox.

As a man got older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. That day, he called his children to a meeting.. He said, "Look at my hair. It used to be so magnificent, but it's completely gone now. My hair can't be saved. But look outside at the forest. It's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair."  "What I want you to do.. the man continued. "Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."  So they did. Each time the forest lost a tree, the children then replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.

Going to Heaven in Style St. Peter is at the Pearly Gates greeting the recently departed. He asks the first man he greets whether he has been faithful to his wife, and the man answers truthfully, "Yes, I never cheated on my wife or even thought of doing so." St. Peter goes through his records and verifies that this is indeed the case, so he tells the man, "Congratulations, you get to go to Heaven in a Rolls Royce." Next, another man comes to the gate and tells him, "Well I did cheat on my wife a couple of times, but we made up both times and we remained happily married in spite of my infractions." Once again, St. Peter goes through his records and verifies this, so he tells the man, "Very well, you get to go to Heaven in a Chevrolet." The third man in like tell St. Peter, "I must confess that I constantly cheated on my wife without ever telling her about it." St. Peter goes through his records once again, verifying that the man had in fact cheated a total of 127 times, so he tells the man, "You need to take a scooter." Disappointed, but accepting his fate, he begins his slow drive to Heaven. After an hour or so, he sees the first man sitting outside his Rolls Royce, disconsolate. He stops his scooter and asks him what's the matter. The man then tells him, "I just saw my wife going by on roller skates!"

The secretary asked, ”Don’t you want to know who sent the food?”  The old woman replied, ”No. Say thanks to whoever sent this.I don’t care WHO the person is because when GOD orders, even the devil obeys.”

And a black Sambuca. And a flute of your best champagne.”  The barman puffs out his cheeks, raises an eyebrow and starts to pour.

Young man gets his first prison sentence… Frankly, he’s pretty terrified as he follows the officer to the cell he’ll likely spend the next 2 years in. The prison officer smirks as he opens the door and says "right, in you go. Make yourself comfortable." The door clangs shut behind him, and he is faced with a huge, great, shaven-headed muscular lump of a man staring at him. The young man offers his hand and says hello, the lump just stares at him, silently. He nervously sits down, and for 20 long minutes there is silence, but he can feel the meat head staring. His low growl of a voice breaks the tension, "Do you want to be mummy or daddy?" The terrifying proposition makes the young man turn to water inside and he knows he is fucked. He has a truly awful decision to make. Shaking, on the edge of tears he murmurs “daddy,” thinking it may be slightly less horrifying an experience. The giant nightmare still staring, finally says quietly, “ok daddy, why don’t you come over here and suck mummy’s cock.”

Poop and heartbeats I read a scientific article about the heart rate and lifespan of most mammals being inversely related. The short-lived animals have fast heartbeats, and the long lived ones have slow heartbeats. But this means that the product of heart rate and lifespan = total heartbeats over the whole life span, is fairly constant across mammals! Turns out, most mammals have about a billion heartbeats in them.  The exception is humans, where the number is  2 to 2.5 billion heartbeats.  Now, in a separate scientific article, I read that most mammals finish their pooping in about 20 seconds.  Again, the exception is western humans, who take anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.  It's 3 am and I am sure there is a deep connection between these two factoids, but I just can't put my finger on it.

I was on a train the other day when two Swedish men sat down next to me. The two introduced themselves as Sven and Olf. Olf was wearing a t-shirt with the USSR flag on and boasted a cap with a hammer and sickle on, so I assumed he was an avid communist. I asked them if either of them knew where I could get alcohol on the train, and Olf piped up:  "If you go to carriage 4, you can get a Guinness, you stupid idiot. You can also find a Stella in carriage 6, dumbass. There's also someone microbrewing in the front of the train, but he looks like a freak."
